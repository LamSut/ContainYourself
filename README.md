# Play with Containers
Here are some practice exercises that I have created to help you learn about containers:
* These exercises are designed to guide you through building, running, and managing containers locally with Docker.
* You can enhance your skills in deploying and orchestrating containerized applications on a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube.
* You will also gain experience about monitoring and visualization of containerized apps using Grafana and Prometheus.

# Docker

## Docker installation
To get started, you'll need to have Docker installed on your machine.  
Please follow the official [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  

## Docker usage
After installation, you can start using Docker to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications.  
For more detailed instructions and advanced topics, refer to the full [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

# Minikube

## Minikube installation
To install Minikube, refer to the official [Minikube Installation Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+download).

## Minikube usage
